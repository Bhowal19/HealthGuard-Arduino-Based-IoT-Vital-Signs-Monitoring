# Cardiac Disease Prediction Using Arduino

This GitHub repository provides information, diagrams, Program Codes for the ML model used , and Arduino code to help users identify the whether they have a Cardiac Disease or not by entering some basic health or medical records like Heart-Rate and Pulse or ECG-reading , all of which will be determined through the use of Body Vital Sensors connected to the Arduino. With the information and tools provided in this repository, users can now predict their own Cardiac related health issues and be far more sure for which doctor to consult in future.

### Abstract

Remote healthcare services have become essential for healthcare providers and health device manufacturers. To offer such services, they require specialized health devices that can collect, store, and transmit various human bio-signals. These devices should be capable of functioning for both short-term and long-term basis. Since the advent of Information Technology, the traditional paper-based methods of data collection have become outdated. These techniques are difficult to analyze, monitor, and extract data from. Furthermore, these old techniques do not allow for the storage and tracking of different patient's health status. In contrast, keeping a record of a patient's medical history is crucial for monitoring their overall health status.

### Introduction

For many healthcare service providers and medical device makers, remote healthcare services are becoming essential. This method needs specialised medical equipment that can receive, store, and send a variety of human bio-signals at either a short- or long-term rate. 
Since IT renaissance, traditional paper-based ways of data collection became a non-preferred utility due to hard analysis, monitoring, or even data extraction procedures, these old technics does not enable data storage to keep track of different patient’s health status. In the meanwhile, historical patient status plays an important role for patient’s overall status monitoring. 
Advanced healthcare devices like Apple iWatch4, Sanatmetal WIWE, present some of nowadays’ healthcare technologies that could keep track of patient’s health status during all day activities. These devices could work for many hours, days, or even weeks depending on the device, hence, it enables continuous patient’s vital signs monitoring.

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to enable users to predict if they have a cardiac disease or not. We provide detailed information, diagrams and Arduino code to help users get started with using the sensors , our Prediction website and the arduino . Our goal is to ensure that not only users but the professinals in the medical field are also able to make use of this tool.
